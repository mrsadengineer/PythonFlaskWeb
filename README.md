# Python Flask Web App  
## Introduction - the project's aim  
App to explore the programming language of Python and to create resources for understanding Flask. Introductory investigation in using python and Flask together with VSCODE and git. Create resource web app for reference python and flask.   

## Technologies
Project is created with:  

Python  3.8.6
Flask   

## Project status
The project is in the beginning. Working through creating content for python and flask section.

## Scope of functionalities (on Progress)
*web ui based app for in python and flask (in progress)  
*documented with github  (in progress)  
*explore python code and libraries  (in progress) 
*deploy with Docker (hasn't start)  
*github actions (hasn't start) 


### Dev Setup and Launch
#### Setup
##### Session System Level  
Install Python  
Install pip  
install virtual environment  
##### Presentation Level      
Create Project App root folder  
Create virutal enviromenet   
    python -m venv <env>  
##### Application Level  
Set Up Editor (VSCODE)  
Add Code  
-Python  
-Flask  
--Templates folder   
--Static Content folder  


#### For Launch in Windows
##### To create virtual environment
python -m venv env

##### Running app option
There are bascially two ways to start a flask app. Within the code using app.run() or through the flask cmd line lagnauge `flask run`  
Depending on your intentions, you would want use the best approche when you ask yourself, "should I use app.run() or flask run?"  

But before running the flask app, make scure the virtual enviroment is running. You can do it manuely or by seting up the python interperter. To manuely activate virtual enviroment by typing in the command line:
  
'env\scripts\activate'  
  
##### Selecting Python Interperter in VSCODE
For Development in VS Code, open the Command Palette (View > Command Palette or (Ctrl+Shift+P)). Then select the Python: Select Interpreter command:

Activate virtual enviroment by:
use Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal     

##### Running by Command Line 
When in the virtual virtual enviroment

python -m flask run

#### Command time commans
To quit session  

`ctrl + c` to exit
