### Dev Setup and Launch
#### Setup
##### System Level  
Install Python  
Install pip  
install virtual environment  
##### Presentation Level      
Create Project App root folder  
Create virutal enviromenet   
    python -m venv <env>  
##### Application Level  
Set Up Editor (VSCODE)  
Add Code  
-Python  
-Flask  
--Templates folder   
--Static Content folder  


#### For Windows Launch
##### To create virtual environment
python -m venv env

##### Running app option
There are bascially two ways to start a flask app. Within the code using app.run() or through the flask cmd line lagnauge `flask run`  
Depending on your intentions, you would want use the best approche when you ask yourself, "should I use app.run() or flask run?"  

But before running the flask app, make scure the virtual enviroment is running. You can do it manuely or by seting up the python interperter. To manuely activate virtual enviroment by typing in the command line:
  
'env\scripts\activate'  
  
##### Selecting Python Interperter in VSCODE
For Development in VS Code, open the Command Palette (View > Command Palette or (Ctrl+Shift+P)). Then select the Python: Select Interpreter command:

Activate virtual enviroment by:
use Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal     

##### Running by Command Line 
When in the virtual virtual enviroment

python -m flask run

#### Command time commans
To quit session  

`ctrl + c` to exit
